# Movie-review-classification
In this project, artificial neural network is used to tackle the problem of sentiment classification of large movie reviews, each consisting of multiple sentences. Artificial neural networks is used to classify the movie reviews as positive and negative based on the sentiment output given by the model. The IMDB movie review dataset is used for training and validating the model. Two models, MLP(multi-layer perceptron) and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) models are trained and tested to find the better model.
Movie reviews are converted in to a series of integers. A Embedding layer, a class of approaches for representing words and documents using a dense vector representation  is used as the first layer for both the models. Keras API from TensorFlow library is used in this project to build, test, validate and predicting model outputs.
